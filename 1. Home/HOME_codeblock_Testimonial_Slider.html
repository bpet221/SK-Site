    <p>Keith, the owner of Sandwich kitchens, was the project manager. A job he is phenomenal at. He always called, emailed, or texted responses to us within a few hours or a day. He does the main cabinet installation as well as other work, but contracts out to plumbing, electrical, paint, etc. His subcontractors were always very professional and clean. Every detail was attended to and he was very organized. We had an entire wall removed between old kitchen and dinning room in a Cape style home. The wall that was removed had a supporting beam, so it had to have a new support beam and support all the way to the basement, per town regs. The removal of the wall, several cabinets, and install of the new beam he did essentially in one day. We moved out of the house for the bulk of the project which took 3 weeks, and Keith sent us pictures and communicated as everything progressed as scheduled. Cost for the project was about $49,000 give or take, but it was a pretty big project. We only needed 1 new appliance, kitchen sink, faucet, quartz countertops, floor to ceiling cabinets, hood, subway tile. new wood floors and refinish wood floors, painting, electrical, lights, plumbing, and odds and ends. Overall, I think his pricing was very fair. Prior to the project he also had computerized drawings of how the space would look. He is very conscientious and pays great attention to detail. I would really recommend him and would use him for a future project because we had such a good experience. <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>Sandwich Kitchens supplied excellent service on our kitchen renovations. I found no one better in quick and detailed communication, as well as thorough and very timely work. From immediately coming for a personable consult to staying on task, they were on the ball and very pleasant to work with the entire time.

    <p>Great! Keith and his crew were outstanding. We had a complete kitchen remodel planned and were impressed by Keith’s knowledge, skills and professionalism. We asked if he was up to a complete remodel which included building a new master bedroom (by combining two bedrooms into one); a master bath, remodeling a powder room; remodeling a kitchen; adding built-ins and chair rails into a living room; and my personal favorite, remodeling a 70’s style sunroom. Keith and his team tackled the project and we are completely satisfied. Although this project came with some headaches and “bumps in the road,” we were impressed by Keith and his team of subcontractors to keep the job moving forward with as little disruption as possible. His plumber was one of the most conscientious and respectful plumbers we have ever used; the painter did an outstanding job; his hardwood floor installer/refinisher was top notch; and the carpenter was the absolute best we have ever had worked for us! This carpenter could and did do anything and everything! Old school: tiles, floors, doors, windows, slider, rough and finish carpentry: he did it all! At one point he stepped in and saved me by hanging pictures, curtain rods and a ton of miscellaneous items that my woman wanted done. Those finishing touches at the end, sealed the deal! Keith, Gerard, Jon, Felipe, Ken and the others, thank you. A+ <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>Keith and his crew are amazing! This is the second time Keith has remodeled a kitchen for me. His attention to detail and meticulous work is second to none. He takes his time but is very efficient. He is a man of integrity and truly cares about the work he delivers. He was in and out in 5 days, excluding the counters (roughly 250 SQ FT). At the end of the project he was not satisfied with the installation of the hood so he came back and made it right. I would highly recommend Keith. <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>The contractor, Keith, really knew what we were looking for. We wanted a kitchen that gave us more cabinet space and we were desperate for more counter space as well. He came up with a design that worked with the space perfectly and quite frankly I can’t believe how beautiful it came out. If there were any demands, Keith put them on himself. He was determined to get as much done with every day he and his carpenter worked. I was so impressed with all the subcontractors. There was an occasion when I had the tile guy, electrician and plumber working at the same time. The counter installer took so much pride in the work he did. What more can I say but I got a lot more than what I expected thanks to Sandwich Kitchen and Bath. <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>Sandwich Kitchens is your last (and only) stop for a kitchen/bath remodel! This spring we decided to remodel our bath/laundry room with cabinetry and countertops. We secured quite a few quotes for this project but none came close to the bid from Keith Petipas, owner of Sandwich Kitchens. His professionalism and attention to detail was well known to us because he did a basement project 15 years ago. Besides the favorable bid, we chose Keith to remodel our laundry room because not only does he supply the cabinetry he is also the contractor. The other kitchen/bath companies we contacted subcontract the labor. Keith takes great pride in his work and does not leave the job until it is PERFECT! Don’t waste your time chasing down bids, go directly to Sandwich Kitchens! Thanks, Keith, for a job well done and, I might add, ON TIME! <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>From my rough idea - Keith Petipas at Sandwich Kitchens designed, built and installed a new Kitchen at my Cape Cod home in Woods Hole. Keith also GC’d the project w.r.t. third party contractors such as plumbing, electric, and floors etc. After meeting Keith only once last November (2016) to go through ideas at my home I decided to engage his services and have been pleased with that decision ever since. The project has been delivered on time, to budget and to a very high standard of workmanship. Throughout the project Keith was utterly professional. Quality of work, attention to detail, direct and honest feedback on issues as they arose, consistent communication and sticking to timelines were the haul marks of this project. This was all the more important as I am currently on assignment in Singapore and had to monitor progress from the other side of the world and with a twelve hour time difference. Despite those constraints Keith maintained regular updates and progress reports and we always felt completely in touch with the process. We could not be more delighted with the final outcome and if high quality work delivered by a trustworthy contractor is what you are looking for I can’t recommend Sandwich Kitchens highly enough. <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>

    <p>Generally well, except for overall timing and schedule. We had expected (maybe unrealistically) 5 weeks of work, but it was more like 8 weeks. Still not too bad for a completely redone kitchen, but longer than our expectations. The 3D modeling was very important in visualizing design options, since we were doing a significant redesign of the 1968 vintage original kitchen. We ended up spending a lot more than we expected (which may have been unreasonably low) but ended up with a very high quality kitchen, probably better than we originally planned for our “beach house”. <span class="view-all-link">...view all</span></p>
